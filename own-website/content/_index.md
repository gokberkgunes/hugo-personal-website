# Gokberk's Website

This website is the collection of guides which I write about the solutions of my
problems and hobbies. I document the configurations, problem-fixes, bug-fixes,
and hacks about the programs I use. For public consumption, the guides
presented here also include references and directions for further information.

I am hosting some alternative front-ends to popular websites and a search
engine. They can be found on the navigation bar in this website.

## Software I Use
- On both website and personal computer [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org) as the operating system,
- For text editing [neovim](https://neovim.io),
- For many other needs, such as terminal and window manager,
  [suckless](https://suckless.org) software,
- Scripts in POSIX shell,
- Code in C, Python and lately [Julia](https://julialang.org),
- Documentation in Latex and Mardown,
- For the website frontend, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a custom CSS and
  bunch of custom shortcodes.
- For the website backend, nothing.
