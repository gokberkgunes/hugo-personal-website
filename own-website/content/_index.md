# Welcome to Berk's Website

This website is the collections of guides that are the solutions of my personal
problems and hobbies. Topics are mostly UNIX and technology centered.Guides
supposed to include references and directions for further information. I am
hosting some alternatives to popular websites, and they can be found on the
navigation bar.


This website is written with Hugo.
