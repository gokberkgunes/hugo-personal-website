I am Gökberk Güneş, a postgraduate civil engineering student at METU in Turkey.
I am currently working on the simulation of breathing throughout the human nose
using computational fluid dynamics simulations. If you would like to get in
touch, you should find the necessary information [here](about-me).

This website is the collection of the guides, experiments, tips and tricks that
I would like to share with others. Also, it is what I would rather spend my
time and develop over social media. Generally speaking, I try to document the
configurations, bug-fixes, and hacks about software I interact throughout the
days. For public consumption, I include references and directions for further
information.

On the nagivation pane, you may find my posts, some alternative front-ends to
popular websites, and a meta search engine.

<!-- I find mathematics and algorithms behind the numerical solutions of
differential equations interesting. -->
