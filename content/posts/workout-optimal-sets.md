## Introduction Collected From RP Hypertrophy
RP (Renaissance Periodization) have been publishing optimal of sets for each
body group to get maximum amount of hypertrophy[^1]. In this text, we will 
cover optimal number of sets and create a short and sweet workout rotation.
We will be using the handy tool created by Ryan Lefebvre, as can be seen
[here](https://github.com/RyanLefebvre/RP-Hypertrophy-Hub-Visualizer) and also
a table given in a [reddit
post](https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/6674a4/dr_mike_israetels_training_tips_for_hypertrophy/). 


## Numbers Collected From RP Hypertrophy
In below table, we can see 
- muscle groups
- number of sets to do in a week to preserve muscle
- weekly sets to do to start properly building muscle
- weekly sets to get optimal muscle hypertrophy

It is important to note that, some of these muscle groups may require less or
more sets depending on three factors: genetics, proper technique and current
muscle size. For example, during calve training if you strecth calves at the
bottom of a calf raise, you can reach optimal volume by doing  half of the
number given in the below table. On another note, one may expect to reach
lower-end of the optimal value if they are beginners and vice versa for
experienced bodybuilders.

| Muscle Group    | Maintenance Vol.   | Starting Vol.   | Optimal Vol.   |
| :-------------- | :----------------: | :-------------: | :------------: |
| Back            | 6                  | 10              | 11-19          |
| Quads           | 6                  | 8               | 9-17           |

| Triceps         | 4                  | 6               | 7-19           |
| Calves[^3]      | 0                  | 1-4             | 4-10           |

| Traps           | 0                  | 0-4             | 7-24           |
| Forearms        | 0                  | 2-8             | 9-19           |


## Example Bodybuilding Routine
In this routine, we will exercise 3 days and have 1 day rest day time
afterwards. However, rest day will have accessory movements that one can prefer
to do in other days. This, routine splits muscles into three categories, namely
push-pull-legs. This way, one can leave a muscle group to rest for a good
amount of time while working out rested muscles. When we follow this program,
roughly, we train every muscle twice every week.

### Day 1: Leg Day

This day consists of 4 movements, they target glutes, quads, hamstrings and
calves. We will do this day twice a week.

During this day, we will do Bulgarian Split Squats (BSS), Heels-Elevated Squats
(HES), Stiff Legged Deadlifts (SLDL) or Romanian Deadlifts, Single Leg Calf
Raises (SLCR). These movements are easily accessible, we would need a bench,
squat rack and dumbbells. Furthermore, replacing these movements are totally
acceptables but we should not pick inferior movements. Thus, we should pick
movements that have tension under stretch, i.e. movements that are fit to be
done as lenghtened partials.

During these movements, try to pause on stretched position for maximum growth.
These pauses allows us to do less sets for the optimal hypertrophy. Therefore,
not only we avoid doing the higher end of optimal value but also we get less
fatigued because of the workouts.

| Movement                     | Muscle Group   | Set/Day   | Group's Set/Week | Optimal Vol.   |
| :--------------------------- | :------------: | :-------: | :--------:       | :------------: |
| Split Squat                  | Glutes         | 3         | 6                | 4-12           |
| Squat[^2]                    | Quads          | 4         | 8                | 9-17           |
| Romanian Deadlift            | Hamstrings     | 3         | 6                | 5-12           |
| Single Leg Calf Raise[^3]    | Calves         | 3         | 6                | 4-10           |

### Day 2: Pull Day
This day will be done twice, and both of the days will be exactly same as shown
below table. During these days, we will do 4 different movements targetting
target traps, back, back delts and biceps.

| Movement                 | Muscle Group   | Set/Day       | Group's Set/Week | Optimal Vol.     |
| :----------------------- | :------------: | :-----------: | :------------:   | :--------------: |
| Front Shrugs             | Traps          | 4             | 8                | 7-24             |
| T-Bar Row                | Back           | 3             | 12               | 11-19            |
| Lat Pulldown[^4]         | Back           | 3             | 12               | 11-19            |
| Inclined Dummbell Curl   | Biceps         | 4             | 8                | 9-19             |
|                          |                |               |                  |                  |



### Day 3: Push Day
In a week we will do two push days, during these days most of the movements are
the same. However, in one of these days we will focus more on front delts, and
during the other we will focus more on triceps. This difference just comes from
second movement in the superset as shown below.

This day's movements are Inclined Bench Press (IBP), Cable Overhead Triceps
Extension (COTE), Front Raises (FR), Overhead Single-Arm Dumbbell Extension
(OSDE), 

During the push day, we will train our chest, triceps, front and middle delts.

### Day 4: Break Day

During this day, you may want to work on your forearms and side delts. Below
table could be done to complete whole body workout.

| :-----------------------                    | :------------: | :-----------: | :------------:   | :--------------: |
| Reverse Wrist Curl Over Bench               | Forearms       | 3             | 12               | 9-19             |
| Palms-Up Wrist Curl Over Bench              | Forearms       | 3             | 12               | 9-19             |
| Lateral Raises                              | Side Delts     | 3             | 14               | 9-24             |

## Summation
During the workouts, focus on progression and to get stronger. Also, during
the sets try to get near muscular failure, 1-2 repetitions shy of failure could be
said as the optimal range. This is basically due to good fatigue to hypertrophy
ratio. 

On the one hand, if we get closer to failure we will not have enough time to
recover. On the other hand, if we do not get close enough to failure, we will
not have enough stimulation for muscle growth.

Lastly, if we are progessing but not getting sore muscles this signals we can
increate volume a little bit. In contrast, if we get sore and this soreness is
affecting us on the next workout we should reduce the volume on that muscle
group.

[^2]: One of the quads is not properly trained here, one should prefer to do leg extensions every other leg workout day.
[^3]: Go deep and pause at stretched position during calf movements. Without this hack, required volume is doubled. 
[^4]: If Lat Pulldown is not available, do Pullups. If both are not possible, prefer bench supported Meadow's Row or Dumbbell Row.
[^4]: Prefer seated for better body stability, and prefer single-arm variations for better focus.
